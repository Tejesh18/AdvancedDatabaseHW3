# **CMSC 608 - Advanced Database**
### **Instructor:** Thomas Gyeera

## Introduction
This document presents an analysis of the `shopping_trends.csv` dataset to extract relevant entities, attributes, and their relationships. The goal is to prepare a structured dataset suitable for database design by identifying primary keys, foreign keys, and composite keys. Additionally, we will represent the extracted schema using Crowâ€™s Foot Notation in an ER Model.

## Identified Entities and Attributes

### **1. Customer**

*   CustomerID (Primary Key)
*   Age
*   Gender
*   Subscription Status

### **2. Product**

*   ItemPurchased (Primary Key)
*   Category
*   Size
*   Color
*   Season
*   Review Rating

### **3. Purchase**

*   CustomerID (Foreign Key)
*   ItemPurchased (Foreign Key)
*   PurchaseAmountUSD
*   Location
*   PaymentMethod
*   ShippingType
*   DiscountApplied
*   PromoCodeUsed

### **4. PaymentMethod**

*   PaymentMethod (Primary Key)

### **5. Frequency**

*   FrequencyOfPurchases (Primary Key)
*   PreviousPurchases

## Identifying Relationships

*   **A Customer can make multiple Purchases** (1:M)
*   **A Product can be part of multiple Purchases** (1:M)
*   **A Purchase uses one Payment Method** (1:1)
*   **A Customer has one Frequency** (1:1)

## Identifying Keys

*   **Primary Keys:**
    *   CustomerID (Customer)
    *   ItemPurchased (Product)
    *   (CustomerID, ItemPurchased) as Composite Key for Purchase
    *   PaymentMethod (PaymentMethod)
    *   FrequencyOfPurchases (Frequency)
*   **Foreign Keys:**
    *   CustomerID â†’ Purchase
    *   ItemPurchased â†’ Purchase

## Crowâ€™s Foot Notation ER Model
The ER Model using Crowâ€™s Foot Notation:

```{mermaid}
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ PURCHASE : makes
    PRODUCT ||--o{ PURCHASE : included_in
    PURCHASE ||--|| PAYMENTMETHOD : uses
    CUSTOMER ||--|| FREQUENCY : has
    
    CUSTOMER {
        int CustomerID PK
        int Age
        string Gender
        string SubscriptionStatus
    }

    PRODUCT {
        string ItemPurchased PK
        string Category
        string Size
        string Color
        string Season
        float ReviewRating
    }

    PURCHASE {
        int CustomerID FK
        string ItemPurchased FK
        float PurchaseAmountUSD
        string Location
        string PaymentMethod FK
        string ShippingType
        float DiscountApplied
        string PromoCodeUsed
    }

    PAYMENTMETHOD {
        string PaymentMethod PK
    }

    FREQUENCY {
        int FrequencyOfPurchases PK
        int PreviousPurchases
    }
```


## Conclusion
This document provides an entity-relationship model for the given dataset, outlining the database structure required for implementation. The Crowâ€™s Foot notation diagram visually represents entity relationships, ensuring a normalized design suitable for efficient querying and data management.
